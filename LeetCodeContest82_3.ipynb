    "826. Most Profit Assigning Work\n",
    "User Accepted: 565\n",

    "We have jobs: difficulty[i] is the difficulty of the ith job, and profit[i] is the profit of the ith job. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have some workers. worker[i] is the ability of the ith worker, which means that this worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[i]. \n",

    "Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.\n",

    "For example, if 3 people attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3.  If a worker cannot complete any job, his profit is $0.\n",
